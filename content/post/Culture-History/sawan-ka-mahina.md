Today is the first Monday of the month of July. This year, coincidentally, it is also the first day of the month of Shravan in Hindu calendar. _Shravan (श्रावण) or Sawan_ is the fifth month of Hindu Lunar calendar. An auspicious month dedicated to Lord Shiva and Goddess Parvati. All Mondays of this month are considered highly auspicious. People keep fast and visit temples and pray for a happy family life.

Shravan marks the onset of monsoon bringing relief from the heat and sweat of the summer. This also marks the beginning of _Chaturmas(चातुर्मास)_.  According to the Vaishnava (वैष्णव) legends (The followers of Vishnu), during this time Lord Vishnu takes a break for four months to rest, and Lord Shiva takes charge of the world. The four months are marked as period between _Ashad Shukl Ekadashi_ and _Kartik Shukl Ekadashi_. The Vaishnavas believe the Lord is at rest, hence no auspicious rituals are performed during this period.

A concept similar to chaturmas is also observed by the Buddhist and the Jain monks. The rains make travelling difficult so they remained at one place and use this time for meditation and learning. 

Shravan is associated with the story of _Samudra manthan,_ when Shiva drank the poison to save the universe from its ill-effects. His body suffered from pain and burns. To ease his suffering, Indra dev ordered rain. As a gesture of gratitude the devotees pour water on the shivalinga. Many devotees walk up to river Ganga to bring _Ganga-Jal_ to perform the abhishek on the Shivalinga.

Apart from the religious aspect, the shravan is significant in North India. This is the time when most women visit their maternal homes to celebrate Raksha bandhan, a bond of togetherness with the siblings. This is celebrated on the Poornima (Full Moon) day marking the end of the month.

Sawan is also associated with many other festivals. Every Monday is considered auspicious. Teej, Nag Panchami and Raksha bandhan are the main festivals celerabrated throughout India. On top of that, regional festivals like Gamha Purnima in Odisha, Pavitropana in Gujrat, Avani Avittam in South India, etc makes this a month long celebration.

Meteorologically, This is the rainy month. It is important to be more careful about our health as monsoon is also the time for viral and water-borne diseases. Hence for a month, Saatvik lifestyle is encouraged. Many people observe fast and avoid eating meat, onion and garlic. In costal areas, it is thought that most fish spawn during this period and abstaining from fishing for a month will lead to increased fish throughout the year.
