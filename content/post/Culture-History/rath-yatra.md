Rath Yatra

The Jagannath temple of puri in Odisha is one of the four most important temples, the Char Dham of Hindu religion. Lord Krishna is worshipped as Jagannath, The Lord of the universe. He resides here with his brother Balbhadra and sister Subhadra. In the month of Ashadh(June-July), an interesting festival is celebrated here wherein the three deities are taken out of the temple. They travel to Gundicha devi temple which is at a distance of 3kms. and stay there for nine days and return to their abode in the Jagannath temple on the tenth day. This Journey is done by chariots that are pulled by devotees. This festival is called Rath Yatra. The procession attracts thousands of devotees from within the country and abroad.

Similar festivals are organized by many temples but the rath yatra of puri is the oldest and most popular. The celebration dates back to the period of Puranas. Vivid descriptions of the festival have been found in Padma Purana and Skanda Purana.

There are many legends that point towards this festival. The most popular story goes on like this- When Krishna was being cremated, his brother Balram was so much in grief that he jumped into the ocean and his sister Subhadra also followed him. At the same time King Indradyumna of Puri had a dream where he learnt that he would find the lord’s body floating on the shores of Puri and he should build a grand temple to house the three deities. His dream came true as he found the bones of Krishna floating in the form of a log. The king built a grand temple for the three Mutris that were carved out of that log by Vishwakarma, the architect of Gods.

Gundicha devi was the wife of king Indradyumna, the builder of the first Jagannath temple. Every year the Lord travels to Gundicha temple where they are treated with their favourite sweets.

This nine day long festival is celebrated with much fanfare and pomp as the devotees flock to seek blessings of the three Gods. This festival is not just a religious ceremony, it is a showcase of Odisha’s rich culture and craft. The preparation starts months before with the building of the chariots. Every year new chariots are built for the occasion. There is a separate chariot for each deity which is beautifully decorated in bright colours. The chariot makers are from the families who have been in this business for several generations. The decorations are done by the tailors of Pipli. Pipli is a tiny village that was established to settle the craftsmen involved in the service of God. The applique work of Pipli is the most popular craft of Odisha and no visitor leaves without buying a sample of this craft which is locally known as ‘Chandua’.

In the temple, The priests also prepare for the festival which is very interesting and full of drama. There are many rituals performed before the yatra. These rituals start from Akshaya tritiya (April). The process of Rath building starts from this day. The day also marks the beginning of Chandana yatra. This is the longest festival and continues for 42 days. The first 21 days are called Bahar Chandana . The Gods from the temple are taken out for boating in a nearby tank. The next 21 days are called Bhitar Chandan and the rituals are performed inside the temple. A paste of sandal and herbs are applied to the Gods for the soothing effect.

Another important day is the Jyeshtha Purnima. This day is celebrated as Deva Snana yatra . The deities are taken for a ceremonial bath and are decorated for a public audience. According to the Skanda Purana, the rituals are performed as per instructions given by King Indradyumn.

After the snana Yatra, the deities are kept away from public view and all the daily rituals remain suspended for 15 days. They are considered to have fallen sick and isolated for treatment. This period is called Anabasara kala. During this period the Moortis are repainted and restored . On the 16th day, the first appearance of the deities for public viewing is celebrated as Nava Yuvajanotsava - The festival of ever new youth. The next day is Ashadh Shukla Dwitiya and the Lord and his siblings are ready to visit their Aunts house at the Gundicha temple.

The three raths are ready. The largest Rath - Nandighosh will carry Lord Jagannath. Balram’s rath is called Taldwaja. The smallest rath Darpdalan is for the sister Subhadra. The three chariots are decorated as per the Unique scheme prescribed and followed for centuries.

Before the Raths are ready to move, the king of puri sweeps the road with a golden broom. We can see many traditional arts of odisha like odissi dance, music and martial art being performed on this day.

As the chariots begin to move, the devotees flock in to hold the ropes. There are thousands of people on the road. The entry into the Jagannath temple is restricted to Hindus only but on this day anyone irrespective of any caste or religion can take part in this journey and get Darshan of the Lord. During this festival special dishes are prepared for Mahabhog. Odisha is known for a variety of sweets, most of which comes from the temple kitchen.

The journey ends at the Gundicha temple where the Lord and his siblings will rest for nine days and then return on the tenth day.

The Jagannath Rath yatra is the grandest and most popularly celebrated festival. To commemorate this event, rath yatra is organized in many cities.
