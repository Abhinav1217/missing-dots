Navaratri comes four times in a year, but the Navaratri occurring in the Chaitra month (March-April) and Ashwin month ( september-October) of the Hindu calendar are more popular and widely celebrated. The other two Navratri which fall in the months of Magh (January-February) and Ashadh (june-July) months are called Gupt (secret) Navratri, mostly practised by someone who needs a special upaye for their problems.

This is the month of Chaitra and this year the Navaratri will begin on 13th April. This Navratri falls in the Spring season and is called _Basanti Navatatri_. The Celebration begins with ‘Ghatasthapana’ or the installation of the Holy Kalash which is filled with water to which some turmeric, coins and rice grains are added. It is covered with a lid under which a stem of mango tree is kept. The lid is filled with clay with some seeds. The seeds germinate during the festival. This pot is a sign of happiness and prosperity. The devotees spend these nine days performing special pujas and Yagnas, dancing and singing devotional songs.

The Chaitra Navratri is believed to be the time of the birth of Devi Parvati, the Goddess of power Shakti. Interestingly, Lord Ram was also born during this Navratri. The festival ends on the ninth day which is celebrated as Ram Navami, the birthday of Lord Ram.

Chaitra shukla Pratipada or the first day of the Navratri is celebration of the New Year in many parts of the Indian Subcontinent. The traditional Hindu calendar, Vikram samvat begins on this day. This year (2021), it will be 2078 according to the vikram samvat.

The Sindhi community celebrates the new year Cheti Chand, which falls on the second day of the Navratri. On this day, they also celebrate the birthday of their main deity, Jhule lal.

The women of Rajasthan and Madhya pradesh celebrate Gangaur on (Teej), the third day of the Navratri. They pray to the eternal couple Shiva and Gauri for the well being and prosperity of their family.
