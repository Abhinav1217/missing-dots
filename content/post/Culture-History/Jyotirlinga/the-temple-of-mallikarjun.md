The second Jyotirlinga, Mallikarjun is situated on Mount Srisailam in Andhra Pradesh. Mount Srisailam is also called _`Kailash of South India`._ It lies in the _NallaMala_ hills and one has to pass through dense forest to reach the temple. The temple is located on the bank of river Krishna, which is here in the form of _Patal-Ganga_ (underground spring). The unique feature of this temple is the combination of **_Jyotirlinga_** and **_Mahashakti_** in one campus and only one of its kind.

> _Mallikarjuna is only temple to have both Jyotirlinga and Shaktipeeth._

The temple complex has a main temple which is dedicated to Lord Shiva who is worshipped as _"Sri Mallikarjun Swamy"_. There is also a temple where Devi Parvati is worshipped in the form of _Bhramaramba Devi_. This temple is listed among the 52 Shakti Peeth. It is believed that the upper lip of Devi Sati fell here. There are many other smaller temples within the complex.

The temple complex, spread over an area of 2 hectares is rectangular with high walls and four gateways topped with _Gopurams_ on four sides. The huge temple built in Dravidian style with lofty towers and sprawling courtyard is considered as a fine example of Vijayanagara architecture. The stories from ancient epics are beautifully carved here. 

The temples of Tripura Kantam, Siddavatam, Alampura and Uma maheshwaram located in the vicinity of the temple complex are the four gateways of Srisailam.

Like most of the ancient temples, this place also has several legends attached to it. As kids, we all have heard the story of young Ganesha having a bet with brother Kartikeya to go round the earth. Ganesha, claimed that his parents were his world and won the bet going seven times around them. What happened next? This is the story of the origin of Mallikarjun Jyotirlinga.

According to the bet, the winner would be married first. The incident mentioned in Shiva Purana tells that on return, when Kartikeya was informed about Ganesha’s marriage, he was upset and feeling cheated left Kailash and went away to _Mount Krounch_. All the existing Gods tried to pacify him but in vain. Then Shiva and Parvati decided to go themselves. When Kartikeya got the news of their arrival, he moved away. Eventually, Lord Shiva and Ma Parvati assumed the form of Jyotirlinga and resided there as Mallikarjun. Mallika is Parvati and Arjun is another name of Shiva.

Another story of the temple coming up here is related to a princess named Chandravati who left the comforts of the Palace and came to live in this forest. She noticed that a cow was going to a secluded place and showering milk on a shivalinga. It was bright and shining like the sun rays. Chandravati built a temple and placed the Lingam there. Since it was found among the Mallige (Jasmine) creeper, it was named as Mallikarjun. This story is carved on one of the stone inscriptions of the temple.

According to a popular folktale of the Chenchu tribe, a native to this forest, Lord Shiva once came here as a hunter. He fell in love with a beautiful Chenchu girl and decided to settle down here on the hill. They believe Mallikarjun Swamy to be their relative and refer to him as Chenchu Mallayya. **The temple is one of the few ancient temples to practice utmost socialism. People of any caste, creed and religion can worship, touch or enter into the sanctum.**

The Nallamala hills are one of the most ancient inhabitable regions of India. The temple here has been in existence since time immemorial and finds mention in various ancient texts. It was visited by Sri Rama and the Pandava brothers. Adi Guru Shankaracharya composed his famous Sivanand Lahiri here.

The temple has been renovated by many famous kings of south India. Visitors to this temple are awe-struck by the beauty of this magnificent temple. There are many other temples nearby. Nature too has blessed this place in abundance. The Patalganga, Srisailam Sanctuary and Dam are worth visiting.
