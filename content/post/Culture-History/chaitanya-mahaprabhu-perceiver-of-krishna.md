Today, is the birthday of Lord Krishna. All over India, Janmashtami is celebrated with high enthusiasm, dancing and chanting what might be most recognizable mantra globally.

> _हरे कृष्ण हरे कृष्ण । कृष्ण कृष्ण हरे हरे ॥_
>
> _हरे राम हरे राम । राम राम हरे हरे ॥_

This mantra is commonly associated with Hare Krishna movement pioneered by International Society of Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON). **Founded in 1966, in New York city,** the ISKCON spiritual society was established by **A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada**, on the principles laid by a _15th century saint Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu._

On the full moon night of 18 February 1486, during lunar eclipse, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu was born in Nabadwip, a town near Mayapur. His given name was Vishvambhar Mishra, but locals called him Nimai ( one who was born under Neem tree ). Another common name among the locals is Gaurangdev for his relatively fair complexion. His parents were respected Brahmin. His maternal grandfather was renowned astrologer of his time. There are many stories of his early age intelligence and wittiness.
