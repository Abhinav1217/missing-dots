According to the Hindu calendar, this is the beginning of the holy month of shravan. The month is dedicated to Lord Shiva, who is worshipped in the form of a _lingam._ There are numerous Shiva temples across the country, some of them are centuries old and very famous. Among these, the twelve **Jyotirlingas** are considered the holiest. The Jyotirlingas are said to have self- manifested _‘swayambhoo_’ on earth. Each Jyotirlinga is considered to be a different manifestation of Lord Shiva. The Jyotirlinga looks like any other Shivalinga. However, it is believed that a person who has attained a certain degree of spirituality sees these lingas as columns of fire piercing through the earth. Every Jyotirlinga has a different story behind how it came to be.

**Adi Guru Shankaracharya** who revived Hinduism in 800CE, has mentioned these Jyotirlingas in his **Dwadasha jyotirlinga** **stotram**. The stotram describes the name and location of each shrine. It is believed that a sincere devotee who recites this stotram regularly washes all his sins committed in seven previous births.

उज्जयिन्यां महाकालं ओङ्कारेत्वमामलेश्वरम् ‖

पर्ल्यां वैद्यनाधञ्च ढाकिन्यां भीम शङ्करम् |

सेतुबन्धेतु रामेशं नागेशं दारुकावने ‖

वारणाश्यान्तु विश्वेशं त्रयम्बकं गौतमीतटे |

हिमालयेतु केदारं घृष्णेशन्तु विशालके ‖

एतानि ज्योतिर्लिङ्गानि सायं प्रातः पठेन्नरः |

सप्त जन्म कृतं पापं स्मरणेन विनश्यति ‖

Jyotirlinga shrines are held in great reverence in Hinduism. The Puranas talk in detail about the significance of the greatness of these Jyotirlingas. These shrines are strategically placed in various parts of the country. Our great saints were wise enough. Their aim was to unite all the people of India by one single thread of devotion. When people undertake pilgrimage together to different parts of the country, they establish bonds of friendship.
