The third temple in the series of Jyotirlingas is the Mahakaleshwar temple of Ujjain in the state of Madhya Pradesh. Located on the banks of river Shipra, Ujjain is among the most ancient cities of India.

The presiding deity in the temple is Lord Shiva who resides here as Mahakaal. The lingam here is Swayambhoo (Self-Originated) and derives Shakti (power) from within itself, unlike other lingam that were established ritually by chanting mantras. The temple has some unique features that make it special. Mahakaal is considered as the king here.

The Shiva Linga is Dakshinamukhi (south facing), unlike the rest of the Jyotirlingas. The main complex is a three-storeyed structure with the lingams of Mahakaleshwar, Omkareshwar and Nagchandreshwar in the lower, middle and upper tiers respectively. The devotees can worship Nagchandreshwar only on the day of Nag Panchami. On regular days it is inaccessible to the common Public.

The temple is famous for the Bhasm-aarti. It is exclusive to Mahakaleshwar temple and is performed early morning with sacred ashes. The word Kaal has two meanings - Time and Death. Mahakaal is the God who controls time, which is beyond man’s control. Aman is reduced to Ash post death,and the Bhasm-aarti symbolises the act of bowing in front of Mahakaal.

The temple is known to exist here since time immemorial. The original structure was destroyed during muslim invasions. The Present temple complex was reconstructed by the Scindias, the maratha rulers of Gwalior.

The temple complex is a spacious courtyard with sculptural finery and sophistication that is influenced by Maratha Bhumija and Chalukya style of structural design. There is a large pool known as Koti Tirth which is considered astronomical. To the east of the Kund lies a huge verandah, in which is the entrance to the path leading to the Garbhagriha where small size images of Parvati Ganesha and Kartikeya can be seen.

Why did The Lord Shiva manifest as Mahakaal here in Ujjain? The answer to this lies in several legends that one gets to know while visiting this place. When Shiva learnt about Sati entering into fire, he was so furious and in agony he broke into Tandav-the dance of death. He was called Mahakaal. Long ago when Ujjain was ruled by a king Chandrasen, There lived a Brahman with his four sons. They were all devotees of Lord Shiva. One day, while they were busy praying when the city was attacked by a demon, Dushan. The brahmans evoked Shiva for help. Shiva originated as Mahakaal and killed the demon. Then on the request of the brahmans and the king, who was also a Shiva-bhakt (worshipper of Shiva) the lord agreed to reside here.

The temple town of Ujjain is a popular pilgrimage centre and attracts millions of devotees every year. Earlier Known as Ujjaiyani or Avantika, the city has always been important and is mentioned in several ancient texts. It is associated with legendary warrior king, Vikramaditya and the famous poet Kalidas. There are many temples and historical places. The temples of Kal Bhairav and Harsiddhi Mata that are worth visiting . The city has also been a centre for astronomical studies. Raja Jai singh constructed the Jantar Mantar here. The temple of Mahakaleshwar itself is built at a point where The ancient Indian Prime meridian and tropic of cancer once intersected.
