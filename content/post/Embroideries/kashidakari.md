Kashmiri stitch, popularly known as Kashidakari, is practised mostly by the menfolks of Kashmir. It is said to have evolved during the Mughal rule. The Kashida motifs are one of the most distinctive styles of embroidery in India. The motifs are inspired by the natural beauty and culture of Kashmir. Flowers, vines, leaves, fruits and birds found in the valley are beautifully depicted on the cloth. Samovar, the famous teapot of kashmir also finds a place in kashida motifs.

Satin and chain stitches were most commonly used in Kashidakari. Now, other stitches are also being incorporated. There are other styles like sozni, ari work and paper mache that comes under the wings of this embroidery.

* The Sozni is created so skillfully that the patterns can appear on both sides of the garment in varying shades of color. This style is perfect for shawls that can be worn with either side showing.
