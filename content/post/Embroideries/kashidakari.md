_Kashmiri_ stitch, popularly known as _Kashidakari_, is practised mostly by the menfolks of Kashmir. It is said to have evolved during the Mughal era, in the region of modern day Srinagar.

The _Kashida motifs_ are distinctive styles of embroidery in India. These motifs are inspired by the natural beauty and culture of Kashmir. Flowers, vines, leaves, fruits and birds found in the valley are beautifully depicted on the cloth. _Samovar, the teapot of Kashmir,_ also finds a place in kashida motifs.

> If you own any Kashmiri dress, or shawl, It probably is Kashidakari handiwork.

* **Sozni** - The patterns appears on the both sides of the garment in varying shades of colour. This style is perfect for shawls that can be worn with either side showing.
* **Ari** - This uses a hooked needle. Beads, stones and zari may be used to give a rich look.
* **Paper Mache** - Style wherein the satin stitch is used to create an almost 3d visual effect. The patterns are outlined with black thread. The motifs resemble stained glass work.

The dense embroidery covering the whole body of the garment is called _Jaamavar_. It is popular on shawls and wedding dresses. _Kashmir-Jaal_ is used to decorate necklines and sleeves of _Phirans,_ which is name given to kashmiri kurties. Jaal, uses an abundance of vines or creepers in its overall design.

Natural fabrics are preferred in Kashidakari, although these days, other materials are also used. The embroidery can be used for both men and women. Besides garments, it is also used for utility items like bed covers, blankets bags wall hangings and carpets.
