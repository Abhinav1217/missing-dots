_Kashmiri_ stitch, popularly known as _Kashidakari_, is practised mostly by the menfolks of Kashmir. It is said to have evolved during the Mughal rule. The _Kashida motifs_ are distinctive styles of embroidery in India. These motifs are inspired by the natural beauty and culture of Kashmir. Flowers, vines, leaves, fruits and birds found in the valley are beautifully depicted on the cloth. _Samovar, the teapot of Kashmir_ also finds a place in kashida motifs.

> If you own any Kashmiri dress, or shawl, It probably is Kashidakari handiwork.

Satin and chain stitches were most commonly used in Kashidakari. Now, other stitches are also being incorporated. Few other styles that are under the wing are:

* **Sozni** - The patterns can appear on both sides of the garment in varying shades of colour. This style is perfect for shawls that can be worn with either side showing.
* **Ari** - This uses a hooked needle. Beads, stones and zari may be used to give a rich look.
* **Paper Mache** - Style wherein the satin stitch is used to create an interesting visual effect. The patterns are outlined with black thread. The motifs resemble stained glass work.

There are also various terms that refer to the different usage of the embroidery. The dense embroidery covering the whole body of the garment is called Jamavar. This is most popular on shawls and wedding dresses. Kashmir-Jaal is used to decorate necklines and sleeves.

Natural fabrics are preferred in Kashidakari, although these days, other materials are also utilized. The embroidery can be used for both men and women. Besides garments, it is also used for utility items like bed covers, blankets bags wall hangings and carpets.
