Zardozi is a form of fabric decoration which uses metallic threads to create beautiful motifs. The word Zardozi is derived from Persian words ‘_Zar_’ or ‘_Zarin_’(Gold) and ‘_Dozi_’ (sewing) that translates as sewing with Gold. It is a popular embroidery style in India, Iran and Central Asian countries.

Although Zardozi is said to have come to India with the Mughal invaders, a kind of work using gold and silver threads on fabrics existed in India since ancient times. The Vedic Texts mention ‘**Kalabattu**’ a craft of decorating fabric with gold or silver wires along with pearls , precious and semi-precious stones. This was used in the temples for the God’s attires and other accessories and for the Royal couples.

Zardozi work involves making complicated designs using gold and silver threads. It is made richer by incorporating embellishments as sequins, beads, pearls and precious stones. The craft was at its peak in the 16th-17th centuries under the patronage of Mughals. It was extensively used to enrich the garments of the court, wall hangings, palanquins, royal tents and trappings for elephants and horses. The work involved real gold and silver threads with precious stones, Pearls that made it richer. It was mainly done on heavy silk, velvet and satin.

The making of zardozi involves various stages- the desired pattern is set on a tracing sheet and holes are made along the traced pattern using a needle. This tracing sheet is placed on position on the fabric on which the embroidery is to be done. The design is transferred onto the fabric using a mixture of chalk and kerosene that is rubbed with a linen on the tracing sheet. The liquid seeps through the holes and the design impression stays on the fabric. The fabric is now stretched out on a frame called ‘_Adda_’. The frame is usually the size of a bed. The craftsman or _Zardoz_ as they are called, sits on the floor behind the frame. There can be six to seven persons working together on a single piece. A Simple or crochet-like hooked needle called ‘Arri’ is used for embroidery. The embroidery work is done manually by the craftsmen, no machine is used in this process. It takes about three to four days to complete a six yard saree with four or five craftsmen continuously working on it. Once the embroidery is complete, the thread is flattened out with a light hammer before it is dispatched for sale.

Zardozi involves using metallic threads and other add-ons which makes it an expensive craft. With the decline of Mughal empire,It became difficult for the artisans to survive due to the loss of royal patronage and they moved on to other parts of India. The craft travelled to the royal courts of Awadh, Marwar, Bengal and Gujrat. It was more innovative now, catering to the taste of its new patrons. Earlier, only floral motifs and verses from the Holy Quran were the main subject, but now birds like peacock, parrots and other symbols appeared along with the floral designs.

Though the royalty has passed, the skill has managed to survive and flourish, adapting to the needs of the market. Lucknow, Jaipur, Bhopal and Kolkata are famous hubs of Zardozi. These days Zardozi is used to make exquisite evening dresses, fashion accessories like handbags and belts, ceremonial adornments like badges and insignia and furnishing accessories like wall hangings, cushion covers and even curtains. It has also paved its way in accessories like bangles, head pieces and shoes. Earlier used gold and silver threads are history now Zardozi uses silk and shiny threads like Dabka, Kasab and Bulliens that are made with cheaper metals.

 Lucknow is a major centre of Zardozi work in India . An evolved version of Zardozi combined with ‘**Dabka**’ is said to have emerged in Lucknow. ‘**Dabka** is a spring type of thread made with a metallic wire that is flattened and twisted around the silk thread.  This delicate and elegant work of Lucknow has been accorded the Geographical indication in 2013. This work is popular for wedding dresses, both male and female.

The artisans of Jaipur prefer working with ‘**Zari**’(Golden thread) and ‘**Gota**’(Golden lace) to make beautiful sarees, lehengas and chunris.

Bhopal is better known for producing fashion accessories. The visitors always carry back beautiful embroidered purses and pouches popular as Bhopali batuas for souvenirs.

Kolkata is a heaven for all types of embroideries. Here the craftsmen are experimenting with various styles to create new designs. Zardozi patterns are created using a combination of golden threads with colored silk threads, making it not only beautiful but also affordable. There are numerous materials that a used to complete a fine piece, stretching from Salma(gold wire), Sitara(sequins), Moti(beads) and semi-precious stones etc are added to enhance the value of work.

Earlier, Zardozi had been a male dominated craft but now many women are taking it as a profession.
