Phulkari is the traditional embroidery of Punjab. Phulkari literally translated as _Floral_ work, the designs include not only flowers but also cover geometrical shapes and other motifs. It was mainly used to make “_odhanis_.” For the people of Punjab, Phulkari is not just an embroidery, It is a tradition, a pious ceremony that begins with the birth of a child.

Traditionally Phulkari is done on Khaddar, a thick hand spun cotton cloth with Pat, the Punjabi word for untwisted floss silk yarn. Khaddar is dyed with colors that are significant. While the widows and elderly women wore white , red and orange were kept for girls. The basic stitch used in most Phulkari is darning stitch which is done on the wrong side so that the desired pattern emerges in front. Other stitches commonly used are chain, running, herringbone and buttonhole

Phulkari is said to have entered India with the Jat community from central Asia. Iran is also considered as the original home of Phulkari as a similar type of embroidery called Gulkari was done there. Phulkari is mentioned in ‘Heer Ranjha’ a famous punjabi folklore by Waris shah whose ancestors lived in Ira

Phulkari was never meant for commercial purposes. It was a part of family rituals. Phukari plays an important role in a girl’s life. There is a phulkari at every special event of her life. The making of Phulkari is interesting. The women of the neighborhood are invited. With some rituals, folk song and gossip, the women not only sew their imagination but also pass on the craft to the young generation. A phulkari may take six months to one year according to the style.

Phulkari can be distinguished on the basis of the color of the base material, type of motifs and the stitches used. The different types of Phulkari are:-

Thirma- This is done on white cloth, a sign of purity. The colors of the threads used are pink or shades of red. It is worn by elderly women and widows.

Sainchi Phulkari- The rural life in Punjab is beautifully depicted in Sainchi. The patterns range from local people,birds,animals, flowers, fruits and vegetables and even means of transport. It is very rare to find this as it is done mostly in ferozepur and Bathinda districts

Darshan dwar- This is a special Phulkari, literally translated as “_The gate to see god_” created to be offered at the Gurudwara upon the fulfillment of any wish or at an important event of life. Scenes from rural life, people, birds, plants etc. are depicted in embroidery.

Chope- The Chope is a dupatta that was made to protect from the ‘evil eye’. It is made by the bride’s maternal grandmother and is used for wrapping the bride after the ritual bath on her wedding day. It was also used to cover the dowry. Chope is done with yellow and golden threads.

Bagh- In this style the stitches are so dense that the base material is hardly visible. Bagh means a ‘Garden’ was made to be worn on wedding and special occasions. It was considered a status symbol of Punjabi family. There are many variations in Bagh, each having a name according to the motifs. A bawan bagh has 52 different patterns, Panchranga and Satranga is made with five and  seven different colored threads, Meenakariis made of white and golden pat and Phulkari using mirrors is called Chhamaas.

Vari-da-bagh - This Phulkari is made by the boy’s mother to be given as a gift to her daughter-in-law, when she enters her new home. It is always made of red or orange khaddar with golden yellow thread which symbolizes happiness and fertility.

Phulkari is a difficult and time consuming craft. It requires artistic skills and patience. With the commercialization, Phulkari has gone through a lot of changes. It has moved from homes to factories where it is done with machines. Now, one can find sarees, salwar suits, tops, Bedcovers, wall hangings etc. with Phulkari designs. The old rough khaddar is also replaced by a variety of fabrics. Synthetic threads in a variety of colors are favoured instead of ‘Pat’. The machine made products are easily available at an affordable price.
