**Sambalpuri** sarees are traditional hand woven sarees from the state of Odisha. These  are made using _`Ikkat`_ or _`Bandhana`_ technique. These are a form of tie-dye, a technique where the yarn is dyed in a sequential manner to get the desired pattern while weaving.

**Baandha** is unique form of layered dyeing, patterns formed are reflective, i.e patterns are identical on both side of fabric. Once the dye is set, It can never be bleached into other colours. 

**Ikkat** weaving is utilized in many traditional textile centres around the world like Japan, Indonesia and Latin America etc. In India, _`Pochampally` from Telangana_ and _`Patan` from Gujarat_ are also known for their version ikkat weaving. Odissa has a unique implementation of resist dyeing technique. The uniqueness of "Bandha of Odisha" has granted it the status of geographically tagged product, in year 2007.

> Baandha can be defined as "A length of systematically arranged yarn, dyed according to a preconceived design in such a manner so as to enable a weaver to portray the design when the yarn is converted to a fabric through the process of weaving". --- [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sambalpuri_sari).

Sambalpuri sarees are made in cotton and silk. They are known for incorporating traditional motifs like shankha, chakra, phula and other tribal symbols. Varieties of Sambalpuri saree include Sonepuri, Pasapali, Bomkai and bapta which are in great demand.

It is believed that this art migrated to Odisha with the Bhulia community, who fled from north India at around 12th century, after the fall of Chauhan dynasty. These sarees are also called Bhulia Kapta by the local peoples of western odisha. 

Sambalpuri textile is popular for its beautiful patterns and bright colours. Apart from sarees, this material is widely used for dress material, furnishing and other useful products. Sambalpuri sarees were made popular by late Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, who often preferred wearing it.
