India has a very rich textile tradition. Indian handlooms are known for their fine quality and richness . Chanderi fabric is one such example. This light weight Fabric with glossy texture has been popular among the royalty and the elites since ancient times.

Chanderi fabric, gets its name from the place of origin. Chanderi is a small town in Madhya Pradesh . A beautiful place on the bank of river Betwa, surrounded by hills, lakes and forests. The historical monuments here are witness to its rich past.

The textile industry in Chanderi is very ancient. It is believed that fabric making in Chanderi was introduced by Shishupal, a Cousin of Lord Krishna,the Chedi ruler of Mahabharat times, but there is no evidence to prove it.

In the 11th-12th cent, Chanderi flourished with intense economic activity because of its strategic position in central India. Chanderi became an important centre of the trade route in central India.

In 1305AD a group of weavers migrated from Dhaka and settled in chanderi. Dhaka was known for weaving fine muslin cloth. These weavers brought with them the technique of fine weaving . The Koshti weavers, who came here a few years later from Jhansi made the fabric more illustrious. The textile industry received royal patronage from the Rajput and Mughal rulers. This soft, Glossy and lightweight fabric was not only loved by the royal household, it was given as a gift of honour.

The industry received a setback during the British rule When the weavers were forced to use cheap quality yarn that was imported from Britain. However, it was revived under the patronage of Scindias of Gwalior. It was at this time the Zari motifs were introduced in Chanderi.

The Chanderi weavers use cotton, silk and zari threads to create three types of fabrics -cotton chanderi, silk chanderi and cotton silk chanderi. Fine motifs using zari threads are woven in hand using various needles that lend a completely different level of sophistication to the sarees. The motifs include flowers, birds, coins and geometric patterns.

The chanderi sarees were woven with hand-spun cotton yarn which was as fine as 300 counts which made it fine as muslin of Dhaka. The fine count cotton was extracted from a special root called the Kolikanda which also gives the glossy finish to the fabric. The yarn used is not made to go through a degumming process like other fabrics.

Although there have been experiments with the yarn used ,Chanderi continues to maintain its charm. This glossy, transparent fabric is becoming popular as it can be worn throughout the year. Earlier, Chanderi was famous only for sarees, but now it is being used for other Indian and western dresses.

Now,at least 5000families in chanderi are engaged in this craft. This fabric is one of the most loved fabrics of the fashion designers.

Chanderi fabric enjoys the protection under the Geographical Indication of Goods Act,1999, thus it cannot be copied elsewhere.

Fabric making is a time-consuming process. It takes almost 7-10 days to weave a saree. We can see looms in most houses here and both men and women are involved in various processes from making the yarn, setting the loom and weaving, thus keeping the age-old tradition alive.
