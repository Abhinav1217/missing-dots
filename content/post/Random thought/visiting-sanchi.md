Sanchi is the most popular tourist destination near Bhopal. A place sacred to Buddhists all over the world, Sanchi is home to Buddhist monuments that came up between the 3rd century B.C. and 12th century A.D. These monuments, built on top of a hill, speak of the glorious past of Buddhism. THe centre of attraction here is The Great Stupa. The stupa, built in the 3rd century, is among the oldest surviving stone structures in India and has great importance in history. It is the finest specimen of art and architecture that flourished in ancient days.

What is a stupa? A stupa is a hemispherical mound that houses cremated remains of Buddha and his disciples. It is now strongly related to Buddhism but Stupas as burial mounds existed much before Gautam Buddha. According to the Buddhist texts, after the death of Buddha, his remains were divided into eight parts and distributed to the eight kingdoms where Buddha lived during his lifetime. In keeping with the traditions, his devotees built burial mounds which developed architecturally into stupas, to house his remains. The Stupas became a place for meditation with a belief that the relics still held the mystic powers.

Almost 300years later the famous Mauryan Emperor Asoka Occupied the throne of Magadha. He entered into a war with the kingdom of Kalinga, the bloodiest war ever fought in history. Though Asoka won the war, the destruction and agony suffered by the people brought a change of heart and he embraced Buddhism. He spent the rest of his life propagating the Buddhist philosophy. He opened the original eight stupas and collected Budhha’s remains and divided them into thousands of portions which were used for building more stupas all over his kingdom and abroad. It is believed that Asoka built about 84,000 stupas, some of them were built on the places that were associated with Buddha’s life.

The Stupa of Sanchi was the first to be commissioned by Asoka. Gautam Buddha had never visited Sanchi in his lifetime. So, why did Asoka choose this site to begin his mission? Asoka, the Mauryan prince was the Governor of Malwa region. His First wife Devi was the daughter of a businessman from Vidisha. Devi was a follower of Buddhism and it was due to her influence that Asoka became a Buddhist. Sanchi is also said to be the Venue of their wedding. The planning and construction work was done under her supervision. Along with the stupa a monastery was also built for the monks and a pillar with Asoka’s famous lion capital was installed. The national emblem of independent India is inspired by this pillar. The stupa has been a focal point of the Buddhist faith since then.

The stupa of sanchi is a grand structure complete with balustrade and four ornamental gateways that attract thousands of visitors. It has been an inspiration for many later buildings. But it is not the one Asoka had conceived. His Stupa was much smaller and made of bricks with a Chhatra( umbrella ) on top. It was surrounded by wooden railings. The present stupa is the result of renovations done over many centuries by rulers of different dynasties that ruled in this region and this is what makes this stupa of sanchi so special.

The renovation of this Stupa began almost a century later under the rule of king Agnimitra of the Shunga dynasty. His father Pushyamitra Shunga, who was the Senapati in the Mauryan army took over the throne by killing the last Mauryan king Brihadrath. During the reign of the Shunga dynasty the stupa was expanded to nearly double the original size. The brick structure was now covered with stone slabs. The dome was crowned by three superimposed umbrella-like structures that symbolize ‘ Wheel of law’ The wooden railings were now replaced with stonThe major work was done in the 1st century during the reign of Satavahanas. The beautiful Torans (gateways) in four directions and the carvings which are the highlights of the Stupa were done at this time. The life of Buddha and the stories from Jatak kathas can be seen in the carvings here. It is interesting to note that Buddha is not depicted as a human, symbols like wheel, footprints or tree are used instead. You can also notice the life of common people, their dresses and fashion of that time. The use of Jataka Tales on stone was first done here. The intricate sculpting was done by the ivory workers of Vidisha.

The statues of Buddha in four directions were added in the 4th-5th century AD during Gupta period. A temple and some inscriptions are seen from this period.

By the 12th century, with the decline of Buddhism, Sanchi too lost its importance. It was rediscovered in the year 1818 by a British General Henry Taylor. The Great stupa is not the only one here. There are several smaller ones scattered on the hill. Due to Sanchi's tremendous archaeological importance, it was designated as a UNESCO World heritage site in 1989.

Sanchi is not the only Buddhist site here, The nearby hills of Sonari and Sattdhara are also important. There are some small stupas that are almost as old as the stupas of Sanchi. These stupas contain the relics of monks. Although these sites are not as well maintained as Sanchi, the breathtaking view of the Satpura hills from here is worth the visit.
